# mu-archlinux

Arch Linux package for [Kreogist Âµ][project-page].

Since version 0.9.3:1, this package no longer contains pre-compiled binary.

To install this package from AUR(will build Mu on your machine during installing):

```bash
yaourt -S kreogist-mu
```

If you'd like skip the long building process. You could add [Archlinux CN community repository](https://github.com/archlinuxcn/mirrorlist-repo) to your pacman, there's exactly same AUR package pre-builded by community build machine.

Once you add it, you can directly install via pacman without building on your machine.

sudo pacman -S kreogist-mu
